# Auto-Generated Rules for Antigravity

This file contains rules automatically generated based on user preferences.

## Deployment Workflow
- **Do NOT push to Git automatically.** Only perform `git push` when the user explicitly asks for it (e.g., "push", "deploy", "update site").
- **Do NOT run `npm run build` automatically.** Only run the build command when the user explicitly asks for it.
- **Do NOT ask for permission to push/build after every edit.** Assume the user wants to keep changes local until they say otherwise.

## General Coding Style
- Use standard React/Vite/Tailwind practices as established in the project.
